# Copper Cable

[__<= GO BACK__](README.md)

## Overview:

1. [Cable Types](#cable-types)
2. [Cabling Standards](#cabling-standards)
3. [Copper Connectors](#copper-connectors)

## Cable Types
- Copper cables (most common, high bandwidth & low price):
- UTP: Unshielded Twisted Pairs (8 wires, 2x4 groups, twisted for protection)
- STP: Shielded Twisted Pairs (foiled for extra protection from interference, more expensive)
- Coaxial: surrounded by insolation, Shielding foil and steel mesh
- Jacket Types:
  - rise: standard patch cable, rack to rack
  - plenum: low emission when burned
  - outdoor: thicker jacket, UV resistant, dry or gel filled
- Wire inside:
  - stranded: many wires twisted together (more flexible)
  - solid: one solid copper wire (cheaper & carries current better)


## Cabling Standards
- Cat Standard: ensures number of twists and throughput
- Cat 3: 10Mb network, mostly used for plain old telephone lines
- Cat 5: up to 100Mb, speeds drops with distance (max 100 meters)
- Cat 5e: 100MHz, up to 1000Mb at full max distance of 100 meters
- Cat 6: enterprise/datacenter, 250MHz, 1Gb at 100 meters and 10Gb for short distance
- Cat 6a: 500MHz, up to 10Gb for full 100 meters

> Higher standard == higher price


## Copper Connectors
- RJ45 mod plug
- Keystone Jack: wall plate, tooled and tool-less
- Patch Panel with 110-style connectors
- RJ11: used in phones, can use same wire as RJ45
