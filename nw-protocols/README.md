> As an aspiring IT and networking professional, one of the core responsibilities is troubleshooting network connections: servers, end-user machines, mail services, and websites. This course introduces the main methods for troubleshooting network connectivity issues using different protocols and command-line (CLI) tools. Networking expert Greg Sowell covers HTTP and HTTPS, the protocols that deliver websites; shows how domain names are resolved via DNS; and explains how voice traffic is carried over a network with VoIP. Greg shows how to examine all of these connections and their traffic using CLI tools such as ipconfig, ping, ARP, and Telnet.

> Protocols are the lifeblood of modern communication. By the end of this course, you'll know what you need to troubleshoot any network connection and keep the communication flowing.

> Note: This course maps to domain 3 of the MTA Networking Fundamentals exam.
