# OSI Models

- Open system interconnections reference model
- Created as a reference model and teaching aid
- Not intended to reflect actual Networking architecture
- Teach how protocols & networks work to carry data
- It has 7 layers (seen below)

__2 Parts of the OSI Model:__
- Abstract: actual model with its 7 layers
- Specifically created Protocols: Protocols not used on Networks



|7 layers          |

|Application Layer |
|Presentation Layer|
|Session Layer     |
|Transport Layer   |
|Network Layer     |
|Data Link Layer   |
|Physical Layer    |

3. [Network](#network)
4. [Transport](#transport)
5. [Session](#session)
6. [Presentation](#presentation)
7. [Application](#application)


### Physical

- layer 1: physical transmission of raw data
- transmitted in 1s and 0s
- defines encoding methods to transmit data
- defines how bits are placed on media
- defines how bits start and stop
- defines media usage specification
- defines media kinds permitted
- defines how physical connection are made
- defines pin usage in physical connection


### Data Link

- layer 2
- provides error free transmission from node to node over physical media
- establishes and terminates links from adjacent nodes 
- responsible for traffic control 
- transmits and receives frames sequentially


### Network


### Transport


### Session


### Presentation


### Application
