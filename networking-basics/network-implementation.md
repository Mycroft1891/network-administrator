## LAN, WLAN, PAN

### LAN
- local area network
- small size or geo area
- TIA/EIA 568-C standard defines characteristics of LAN
- uses twisted pair cabling to connect devices
- use CAT6 or A6 cabling for LAN
- hierarchical star only topology recognized by 568-C
- LAN node tied together with switches and hubs
- can use fiber optic to connect switches

### WLAN
- wireless local area network
- standard LAN that uses wireless referred to as WIFI by IEEE 802.11 standard

### PAN
- personal area networks
- IEEE 802.15 standard
- primary Blue Tooth technology
- limited range
- less power to generate signal (keyboard, mice)
- Infrared can also be used


## SCADA/ICS and Mechanics

Special Network

### SCADA
- Supervisor Control and Data Acquisition
- Span large GEO areas (Pipeline, Power distribution)
- More specific version of ICS

### ICS
- Industrial Control System
- Generic term smaller scale systems than SCADA
- Industrial Automation, Control System for Power Plant

### Medianet
- optimized to distribute large video apps & similar technologies (Hulu, Netflix)
- uses smart bandwidth detection systems
- allows medianet to adjust to higher/lower bandwidth devices


Both SCADA and ICS are networks and technologies used control industrial applications
